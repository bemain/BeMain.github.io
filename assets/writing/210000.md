Winds may change and fires may burn low
but know that for greater things you're bound
The road might be long and you may pick the wrong turn at every bow
yet what is already lost can only be found
It might turn night and hope may fly
yet what is already dead can never die

When I soon enough hear death 
knocking firmly at my door
When I draw my final breath 
and it leaves me longing for more
Then I can't another minute buy
But what you give life will never die

Winds may change and fires may burn low
But I know your love is all around
I may lose myself in the storms that blow
Yet in you I'm already found
It may turn night and hope may fly
yet what you give life will never die
